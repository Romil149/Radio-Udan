## Open Bugs

| ID | Severity | File | Description | Found By | Status |
|----|----|---|----|----|-----|
| BUG-005 | 🔴 Critical | `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | Release APK missing `INTERNET` permission — app cannot reach staging API; black screen after splash | User report | Fixed (pending rebuild) | `browser_fill` on phone field sometimes does not update Flutter state (validation: “10-digit” while field looks filled). Workaround: click field → fill → Enter. “Verify and continue” needs bottom button click or semantics tree; Enter alone unreliable on OTP screen. | Agent 12 (IDE browser) | Open |
| BUG-004 | 🟢 Low | `go_router` | Direct URL `#/events` fails (`no routes for location: /events`); tabs are shell-only (`/`). | Agent 12 | Open (by design) |
| BUG-001 | 🟡 Medium | `.cursor/agents/README.md` | README referenced non-existent `agent-03-wp-app-api.md` (fixed) | Developer | Closed |
